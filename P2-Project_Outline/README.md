## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Premier League Football Fantasy offers tables of data to help the user make a decision on which player/players they may want to sell or buy. The tables however are often times not quite useful to compare players. Say we need to compare a striker in the 16th row with another one on the 57th row; that will require scrolling up and down while trying to keep track of these two rows and the columns/values according which we are comparing. To make this process less laborious and more user-friendly, a few features will be implemented to optimize the process of comparing players through concise tables, graphs, and timelines.
### Features
Player-Card: Provides detailed/customized information about a player.
Head-to-Head: Abbility to compare two players head-to head.
Timelines: track player's performance through time.
WatchList: add players to a watchlist.
